# 🕸️ Web Scraping Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Web Scraping Learning Repository**!  

This repository documents my **learning journey in web scraping** — from basic tutorials and practice scripts to full projects that apply web scraping for real-world use cases.  

---

## 📘 Overview

This space serves as a personal learning hub where I explore:
- How to extract data from websites using **BeautifulSoup**, **Requests**, and **Pandas**.  
- Building structured datasets from unstructured web pages.  
- Applying web scraping in data analysis and automation projects.

The repository will continue to grow as I learn more advanced techniques and take on larger scraping projects.

## 🎯 Learning Approach

My learning process combines:
- 📺 **YouTube tutorials** – for step-by-step practical demonstrations and real-world examples.  
- 🤖 **Generative AI assistance (ChatGPT)** – for concept explanations, debugging, and code refinement.  

This combination helps me understand not only *how* web scraping works, but also *why* certain approaches are better in different contexts.
